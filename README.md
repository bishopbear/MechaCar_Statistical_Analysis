# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

The metric to be tested is vehicle emissions.

Null Hypothesis:
Our null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the emissions generated between MechaCar and the competition.

Alternative Hypothesis:
our alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant difference between the emissions generated between MecharCar and the competition.

Statistical test to use:
Unpaired two sample t-test
the reason for an unpaired two sample t-test is that the samples would come from the different auto makers and not all from the same population. 

Data needed:
In order to effectively use the unpaired two sample t-test we would need to gather sample data from each car company that MechaCar considers its competition.

We are hoping to show that MechaCar vehicles emit significantly less emissions than the competition. If so, we encourage MechaCar to use this in marketing efforts. If not, this can help to provide valuable insight into how MechaCar can improve their overall product.
